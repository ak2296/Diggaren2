# Diggaren!
The project used to be done by 4 but 2 'SYS' students didn't show up after a while so we continued doing it therefore it is not as the project recommendation describes (less complicated). 
It is a mesh api web app that takes the songs names and artist names from 3 swedish radio channels(can be expanded to more channels) and on click 
searches it on spotify and lets the user to listen and even dig further by entering the spotify online app for further actions.
the app signs in to user's spotify account at the start. By choosing a channel through dropdown menu the data appears on 
related boxes of current, previous and next songs playing from that channel. By clicking on each box a list of maximum 9 songs with the same name will appear under the boxes
(this could in later developments be filtered with artist name to higher the percision).
the SR API returns XML but Spotify returns JSON this made the work less flowing and more time consuming, if not a pain in the neck!
